# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Prediction

## Overview
This project analyzes COVID-19 data using data science and machine learning techniques. It explores trends, performs clustering, and applies regression models to predict future cases. The project leverages Python libraries like **Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, and scikit-learn** for data analysis and visualization.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning & Processing:** Prepares COVID-19 datasets for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes trends in confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
- **Clustering Analysis:** Groups countries based on mortality and recovery rates using **K-means clustering**.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Uses **Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression (degree 8), and SVM Regression** to forecast future cases.

## Datasets Used
- **`country_wise_latest.csv`**: Country-wise summary of COVID-19 cases.
- **`covid_19_clean_complete.csv`**: Time-series dataset with worldwide COVID-19 data.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/covid19-analysis.git
   cd covid19-analysis
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:
```bash
jupyter notebook Untitled10.ipynb
```

## Key Insights
- Trends in COVID-19 case growth worldwide.
- Clustered countries based on severity of impact.
- Regression models for predicting future cases.

## Future Improvements
- Integrate real-time COVID-19 data sources.
- Enhance model accuracy with deep learning techniques.
